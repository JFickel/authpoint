- authpoint -
http://github.com/zquestz/authpoint

Simple shell for rails 3 using omniauth.

This app uses bundler, and rvm is recommended. By default it uses the 1.9.2@authpoint gemset.

Setup is pretty easy.

* Clone the repo
* Run 'bundle install'
* Edit 'config/database.yml'
* Run 'rake db:create db:migrate db:test:prepare'
* Setup 'config/providers.yml'
* Run the specs and make sure everything passes with 'rake spec' 

These docs are obviously very rough, more info will be coming soon.
